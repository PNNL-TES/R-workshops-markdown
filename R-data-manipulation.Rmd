# Introduction {.bigger}

## The plan

A short workshop covering reproducibility and data management; data filtering, reshaping, and joining; and summarizing.

* Reproducible research and data management (~15 minutes)
* Filtering and cleaning data (~30 minutes; the `gapminder` dataset)
* Reshaping and joining data (~30 minutes)
* Summarizing and manipulating data (~60 minutes; the `babynames` dataset)

## Requirements

**This workshop assumes a basic to intermediate knowledge of R.**

If you want to do the hands-on exercises (encouraged!), make sure up-to-date versions of the following packages are installed:

- `dplyr` - fast, flexible tool for working with data frames
- `tidyr` - reshaping and cleaning data
- `ggplot2` - popular package for visualizing data
- `gapminder` - life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for 142 countries
- `babynames` - names provided to the SSA 1880-2017

The first two constitute a [particular and popular dialect of R](http://tidyverse.org), but the principles we'll go over are broadly applicable. (I will point out base R equivalents as we go.)


# Reproducibility and data management {.bigger}

## Reproducibility...

We are in the era of collaborative 'big data', but even if you work by yourself with 'little data' you have to have some skills to deal with those data.



<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
**Most fundamentally, your results have to be reproducible.**

>Your most important collaborator is your future self. It’s important to make a workflow that you can use time and time again, and even pass on to others in such a way that you don’t have to be there to walk them through it.

## ...is the future

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
Even if you don't buy it, **prepare yourself for the future**. Funders, journals, governments, colleagues are all pushing for more reproducibility and openness. It's a slow but steady ratchet.

NSF, DOE, Wellcome, Gates, etc. are increasingly requiring data management plans; data deposition; and publication in open-access journals.

Reproducibility generally means *scripts* tied to *open source software* with effective *data management* and *archiving*.

## You can't reproduce

...what you've lost. What if you need access to a file as it existed 1, 10, or 100, or 1000 days ago?

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- Incremental backups (minimum)
- Don't depend on yourself! Has to be _automatic_.
- Version control. A *repository* holds files and tracks changes: what, by whom, why
</div>
<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
<img src="data-manipulation-images/tardis.jpg" width="400" />
</div>

## Version control

**Git** (and website [GitHub](https://github.com)) are the most popular version control tools for use with R, and many other languages. They offer:

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
- Version control
- Sharing work with collaborators in a *repository*
- Issue tracking
- Public or private code
</div>

 <font size="2"> https://xkcd.com/1597/ </font> 

</div>

## Scripts for data analysis

Version control and scripts address two of the biggest problems with 
managing code and data:

* Tracking *changes over time*
* Understanding/reproducing *analytical steps*.

**Ideally, _every_ step in your analysis is programmatic**. 

This means it is performed by a script, so it can be understood and reproduced in the future.

## Reproducibility is a process

*Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.* 

Upgrade and improve your workflow and skills over time:

>Organizing analyses so that they are reproducible is not easy. It requires diligence and a considerable investment of time: to learn new computational tools, and to organize and document analyses as you go.

>But partially reproducible is better than not at all reproducible. Just try to make your next paper or project better organized than the last.

A great and practical guide: http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/

## Reproducible research example

A typical project/paper directory for me, slightly idealized:
```
1-download.R
2-prep_data.R
3-analyze_data.R
4-manuscript_report.Rmd
logs/
output/
rawdata/
```

This directory contains *scripts* that are backed up both *locally* and *remotely*. It is under *version control*, so it's easy to track changes over time.

There's also [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), i.e. fully automated analysis workflows...but that's a topic for another day.


# Filtering and cleaning data {.bigger}

## gapminder

In honor of the late [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), we'll use the `gapminder` dataset today.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

Read the help page about `gapminder`.

## Pipes and pipelines

The `magrittr` package (used by both `dplyr` and `tidyr`) provides the `%>%` operator, which allows us to _pipe_ an object forward into a function or call expression.

Note that `x %>% f` is _usually_ equivalent to `f(x)`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(gapminder)

library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% print()
gagminder %>% head()
gapminder %>% head(n=20)
gapminder %>%
  print() %>%
  summary()    # what is non-piped equivalent?
summary(print(gapminder))
```

RStudio has a [keyboard shortcut](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE) for this.

R now (as of v4.1) has its own built-in pipe operator: `|>`.

## dplyr

The `dplyr` package uses _verbs_ (functions) to operate on _tibbles_ (data frames).
When using pipes, this looks like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
some_data_frame %>%

  do_something() %>%

  do_something_else() %>%

  getting_dizzy_from_so_much_doing()
```

Let's go over some of those possible `do_something` steps.

## Filter

Very commonly used, as it lets you _filter_ a dataset by one or more conditions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Egypt")
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Egypt", year > 2000) # AND
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Egypt" | year > 2000) # OR
gapminder %>% 
    filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "New Zealand", "Chad"))
```

This is equivalent to base R's `subset` function.

## Filter

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1997) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

## Select

Also extremely useful. Note the different notations for selecting columns:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(gapminder, pop, year)
gapminder %>% select(pop, year)
# Base R equivalent: gapminder[c("pop", "year")]
gapminder %>% select(-lifeExp, -gdpPercap)
gapminder %>% select(-1)
```

There are lots of other cool ways to select columns--see `?select`.

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(starts_with("c"))
```

## <span style="color: red;">Exercise: filtering and selecting</span>

Let's focus on a single country's data for a bit. Write a pipeline that picks 
out Egypt data only, removes the continent and country columns, and assigns 
the result to a variable `Egypt`. How many rows does the resulting dataset have?

Let's focus on a single country's data for a bit. Write a pipeline that picks 
out Egypt data only, removes the continent and country columns, and assigns 
the result to a variable `Egypt`. How many rows does the resulting dataset have?

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Egypt") %>%
  select(-continent, -country) ->
  Egypt
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Egypt
```

## Uniting and separating

These functions can be very useful.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
gapminder %>% unite(coco, country, continent)
gapminder %>%
  unite(coco, country, continent) %>%
  separate(coco,
           into = c("country", "continent"),
           sep = "_")
```

## Mutating and renaming

The `mutate` function in particular is used a _lot_ in `dplyr` pipelines.

```{r}
Egypt %>%
    mutate(logpop = log(pop)) %>% 
    rename(population = pop)

# base R:
# gapminder$logpop <- log(pop)
# colnames(gapminder)[colnames(gapminder) == "pop"] <- "population"
```

## Data cleaning

Two handy `tidyr` functions allow you to fill data downward, and fill
in `NA` values.

```{r}
people <- tibble(who = c("Alice", "Bob", "Carol"), age = c(25, NA, 45))
people %>% fill(age, .direction = "down")
people %>% replace_na(list(age = 99))
```


# Reshaping and joining data {.bigger}

## Reshaping ("pivoting") data

Let's start with the simple `people` data frame, but with a couple more columns:

```{r}
people$height <- c(160, 170, 180)
people
```

Note that there is one column of _metadata_ (name) and two of _data_ 
(age and height).

## Make data longer

Let's say we want to put `people` into long (or _tidy_) format--where every row
is a different observation. In other words, we need to collapse multiple
columns of data into a single one.

For this we use `tidyr::pivot_longer()`, which at a minimum needs to know: 
what's the data source, and what column(s) do we want to pivot?

```{r}
people %>% pivot_longer(c("age", "height"))
```

(Note base R has a `reshape` function, but I find it difficult to use.)

## Make data longer

We could also say "pivot everything except for the 'who' column", or provide
custom column names in the resulting data frame:

```{r}
people %>% pivot_longer(-who)
people %>% pivot_longer(-who, names_to = "variable", values_to = "datum")
```

## Make data wider

To transform data into a wider form, `pivot_wider` needs to know at least
two things: which column holds the new column names, and which the data.

```{r}
people %>% 
    pivot_longer(-who) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = "name")
```

Here `tidyr` has guessed that if the names of the new columns are coming from
"name", then the values are probably coming from the numeric column "value".

And so we get our original `people` data frame back.

What happens if we take column names from the "who" column?

## Make data wider

Pivoting data wider may result in `NA` values if not every combination
row-column combination is present in the dataset:

```{r}
people %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = "who", values_from = "age")
people %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = "who", values_from = "age", values_fill = -1)
```

## Reshaping gapminder data

Time for something a bit more complex. Back to our gapminder-derived `Egypt`
dataset!

```{r}
Egypt %>% 
    pivot_longer(c(lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap))
```

## Reshaping gapminder data

```{r}
Egypt %>%
  pivot_longer(-year) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, value)) + geom_line() +
   facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free")
```

Experiment. Why do these do what they do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Egypt %>% pivot_longer(lifeExp)
Egypt %>% pivot_longer(-lifeExp)
```

## <span style="color: red;">Exercise: reshaping</span>

Our `Egypt` dataset has one row per year, and three data columns. Write code
to transform it to have one row per datum, and each year in a
different column. Do this for post-2000 data only.

Hint: start by filtering and then pivoting it into _long_ form.

different column. Do this for post-2000 data only.

```{r}
Egypt %>% 
    filter(year > 2000) %>% 
    pivot_longer(-year) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = "year")
```

## Joins

Frequently we have more than one data source:

```{r}
people
hometowns <- tibble(who = c("Alice", "Bob", "Dave"),
                    where = c("Abilene", "Billsville", "Darien"))
hometowns
```

Here, we'd like to `merge` (the base R function) or _join_ these together.

## Left joins

Probably the most commonly used join is `left_join`.
This works by including all rows in the _first_ data frame, and any
matches it finds from the _second_:

```{r}
people %>% left_join(hometowns)
```

In other words, it's a _lookup_.

Note the message. **It's good practice to specify the common columns** 
that joins should use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
people %>% left_join(hometowns, by = "who")
```

## Left joins

The order matters. Why do these produce different results?

```{r}
people %>% left_join(hometowns, by = "who")
hometowns %>% left_join(people, by = "who")
```

## Other joins

There are many different join operations available.

```{r}
people %>% right_join(hometowns, by = "who")
people %>% inner_join(hometowns, by = "who")
people %>% full_join(hometowns, by = "who")
people %>% anti_join(hometowns, by = "who")
```
